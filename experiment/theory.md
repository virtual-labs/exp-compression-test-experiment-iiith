 Structure components such as columns and struts are subjected to compressive load in applications. These components are made of high compressive strength materials. Not all the materials are strong in compression. Several materials, which are good in tension are poor in compression. Many materials poor in tension are good in compression. Cast iron is one such example. This strength is determined by conducting a compression test. During the test, the specimen is compressed and deformation Vs. the applied force is recorded.

Compression test is just opposite in nature to tensile test. Nature of deformation and fracture is quite different from that in tensile test. Compressive load tends to squeeze the specimen. Brittle materials are generally weak in tension but strong in compression. Hence this test is normally performed on cast iron, cement concrete etc. But ductile materials like Aluminium and mild steel which are strong in tension are also tested in compression.
