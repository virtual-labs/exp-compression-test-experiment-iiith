Observation 1: 

   - Initial length or height of specimen h =______mm.
   - Initial dia of specimen d0 =_____mm.
 
**Procedure for the experiment is as follows.**

1. Dimensions of test piece is measured at 3 different places along its height/length to determine the average c/s area.
2. Ends of the specimen should be plane. For that the ends are tested on a bearing plate.
3. The specimen is placed centrally between the two compression plates, such that the center of moving head is vertically above the center of specimen.
4. Load is applied on the specimen by moving the movable head.
5. The load and the corresponding contraction are measured at different intervals. The load interval may be as 500kg.
6. Load is applied until the specimen fails.
