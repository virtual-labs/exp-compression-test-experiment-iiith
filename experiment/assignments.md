Q1. Compression tests are generally performed on brittles materials-why?

Q2. Which will have a higher strength: a small specimen or a full size member made of the same material?

Q3. What is column action? How does the h/d ratio of specimen affect the test result?

Q4. How do ductile and brittle materials differ in their behavior in compression test?

Q5. What are bi-modulus materials? Give examples.

Q6. In cylindrical specimen, it is essential to keep h/d to avoid lateral instability due to bucking action.
