 A compression test is a method for determining the behavior of materials under a compressive load. Compression tests are conducted by loading the test specimen between two plates and then applying a force to the specimen by moving the crossheads together. The compression test is used to determine elastic limit, proportionality limit, yield point, yield strength and compressive strength.

**Compressive Strength :-** It is the maximum compressive stress that a material is capable of withstanding without fracture. Brittle materials fracture during testing and have a definite compressive strength values. The compressive strength of ductile materials is determined by their degree of distortion during testing.

**Objectives:**

 To determine the compressive strength of given sample.
